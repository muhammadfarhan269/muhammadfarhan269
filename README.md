Hi, I'm Muhammad Farhan

Principal Full-Stack Engineer | Technical Lead

I have over 6 years of experience architecting, scaling, and deploying enterprise-grade web, AI, and 3D/AR applications.

I work with startups and digital teams that need end-to-end technical ownership — helping them turn complex ideas into scalable, production-ready SaaS platforms. My focus is on delivering clean architecture, reliable systems, and maintainable code that supports long-term growth.
